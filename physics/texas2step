I am going to count the elements, from 1-118, using the texas 2-step way.
It is the only way appropriate for nucleonos which build elements using a pair
of nucleonos which have been sewed together topologically using mobius strips
using alf4o particles.
We start the count with 1,2,3-these are all babies, no alf4o yet. Then
1
2
3
Now we have enough and our first alf4o will be(and we realize we could have
started with 111 and might even have named it Lithium.
121
212
222
232
323
333
343
434
444
454
545
555
565
656
666
676
767
777
787
878
888
898 
989
999

Stopping for a moment (since we are using base-10 and so out of single-space
digits; just add the digits to get the atomic number. The Texas 2-step is-
THE digits always differ by at most 1.
 If all the same step forward by making middle larger by 1. 
THE SUM HAS INCREMENTED ONCE.
 Then move outer forward by 1, and middle back by 1-just reversing the three.
THE SUM HAS INCREMENTED ONCE.
 Now middle catches up.
THE SUM HAS INCREMENTED ONCE.

just keep it up.

After the 38TH time stop. You made 3 babies, then 38 alf4o's,
and are left with element 118 which you should name Og.

You should now start thinking of energy levels, and isotopes.
After we figure out what those Terms mean.
