	The background is my learning in 1960 of a Theory of Time and Space
	based on intervals of time and regions of space rather than mythical
	"instants" and "points". This led me on a meandering path to becoming
	a professional mathematician, turning a math department into a
	math, statistics, and computer science department which I chaired for
	21 years, through a research career in topology, and computer
	networking to finally realizing how it all fits together.

		Ron Desmet has spent his career explaining Whitehead, who
		knew so many of the facts and figures
		involved from the beginning.

A short explanation of why formulas have not been the answer.
Much more detailed versions to follow soon.

picture that convinced me. Trying to describe an event in terms of
what I sense about space, we find LR,UD,and NF. This gives the 8 vertices
RUF,RUN,RDF,RDN,LUF,LUN,LDF,LDN and 6 faces R,U,F,L,D,N familiar to us all
(since the time of Plato) and 12 edges (labelled in appropriate ways by a pair
of faces. Thinking topologically of the box with inside and outside,
it is easy to iew each edge as a small tube between vertices, and this picture
shows some of those tubes. 
Now seeing "event-particles' as tiny volumes entering or leaving the box at
LDN/RUN, travelling one wa or the other along that tube(colored magenta),and
coloring the entry/exit edges apropriately red or blue indicating a gain or loss
of something(say energy?) and using green for intermediate paths, we find the
pattern (that much of my topological career has been buit upon).
This pattern can be viewed in terms of singlet-triplet rather easily,and that
is something spectroscopists have seen, and quantum-theorist have tried to
describe by viewing only formulas.
Lets say you are changing energy going between LDN and RUF. You follow the
pattern R--B, and to cross that gap you have only green. But following green
you can go straight or visit some neighbors, but only by singlet-or-triplet.
More detailed explanations will not change what actually happened. Nonsense
about "convex cumbinations" and "Hermitian conjugates" and so on mean I am
playing with symbols to make things seem more true; they are likely to be
symbols that get in the way!
