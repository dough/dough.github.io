	The background is my learning in 1960 of a Theory of Time and Space
	based on intervals of time and regions of space rather than mythical
	"instants" and "points". This led me on a meandering path to becoming
	a professional mathematician, turning a math department into a
	math, statistics, and computer science department which I chaired for
	21 years, through a research career in topology, and computer
	networking to finally realizing how it all fits together.
