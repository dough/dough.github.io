Most of the things we see around us can be ckassified into one of **The 4 P's**.
A display screen is a **Push** and will output even if noone is watching.

A keyboard is a **Push** which just waits for someone to type, and may just discard its
output if no computer is attached.

A computer is a **Pump**, which probably has a **Push** attached for its output,
and a **Pull** for its inputs in hopes that someone will type. Or it may be busily proccesing data from some device such as a thermostat that constantly **Push**es what it has learned.
