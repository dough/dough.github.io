	</li>One of only two papers on clustering, and (by far) the most widely known and referenced paper,set up a means of guessing The most likely
	structure for a complex system. Also these are the only 2 joint papers I have ever written (and all the writing and dissemination are due to Bezdek!
	The mathematics is joint.

	</li>the last published paper of my topological research career, recently discovered by others abd described as "remarkable" and "a little known gem",
	I have recently discovered a connection with the space and time I have been stuying in physics!
