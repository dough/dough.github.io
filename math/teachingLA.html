	I have only taught "Linear Algebra" once in my life.
	</p><p>It was when
	<a href="https://math.mit.edu/~gs/">Gilbert Strang</a>
	came out with a wonderful book and I wanted to Learn by Teaching.
	I had studied linear
	algebra once at Rice as a sophomore from an extremely old-fashioned text
	and knew those methods were not a feasible way to get something done.</p><p> 
	
	  In high school I had  bought a transistor ($15 point contact from Sylvania)and learned about "Thevenin equivalent circuits", so naively for years wondered
	  why I was too stupid to solve the linear equations to build an amplifier. Strang finally let me see I was not stupid, my methods were silly!</p>
	<p>
	  I have not forgotten the day in class after I had "shown"
	  (literally) that the product of upper triangular matrices is upper
	  triangular (one easy picture) and some student wondered if we were
	  going to prove it!
	  My answer of "I just did!" was not satisfying to him so I said"If
	  you want me to waste our time by trying to figure out how to put
	  this into symbols so it seems more formal it will not help and there
	  will be deeper Truths we never see!".</p>
	<p> From the picture we see that in the easy dot product of one row
	and another column there is a 0 in every product of elements. It does not'make it more true if we assign row and column numbers, just more seemingly formal.
